# About Me
Hi, I'm Tim Little. In American terms I would be described as a "high school teacher" but here in the UK I teach A level Computer Science in [BHASVIC](https://www.bhasvic.ac.uk/), a large [6th form college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_form_college#United_Kingdom) on the South Coast.

## A bit of context
I graduated from Manchester University in 1989 then worked in industry as a senior analyst/programmer, mostly around FinTech. Professionally I started with ANSI C in the 90s, then on to creating ASP pages using VBA and VB. Quite a lot of SQL (mostly SQL Server) and some HTML/CSS with a bit of Java thrown in.

## Now
The languages I mostly teach are C and Java, although I have dabbled teaching Python. In the past I have taught BASIC to KS3.

## Current personal projects
As well as the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) competition which I usually start but don't finish I also have an on going Java project for the board game Diplomacy and a Flutter and Dart project to make a timetable app for teachers

[Flutter and Dart Timetable](https://github.com/timjlittle/FlutterTimetableApp) Flutter/Dart, Android Studio   
[Diplomacy](https://github.com/timjlittle/Diplomacy2/tree/master) Java/Swing, NetBeans  
### Advent of Code  

- [2021](https://github.com/timjlittle/AoC2021/tree/main) A mix of C and Java
- [2022](https://github.com/timjlittle/AoC2022) For some reason I am missing quite a lot of this
- 2023 This is on another account
- [2024](https://github.com/timjlittle/AoC2024) Java

## Future plans
I would like to explore more Python, especially in regard to data handling. I also need to learn more about JSon and re-visit XML. I would quite like to explore connecting the Flutter/Dart app to Google services such as Calendar and to create a Flutter/Dart App front end for the Diplomacy project, which would feed player's orders to a back end engine.
