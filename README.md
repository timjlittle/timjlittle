# About Me
Hi, I'm Tim Little, in American terms I would be described as a "high school teacher" but here in the UK I teach A level Computer Science in a large 6th form college on the South Coast.

## A bit of context
Before teaching I worked in industry as a senior analyst/programmer, mostly around Fin Tech. Professionally I started with ANSI C in the 90s, then on to creating ASP pages using VBA and VB. Quite a lot of SQL (mostly SQL Server) and some HTML/CSS with a bit of Java thrown in.

## Now
The languages I mostly teach are C and Java, although I have dabbled teaching Python. In the past I have taught BASIC to KS3.

## Current personal projects
As well as the annual Advent of Code competition which I usually start but don't finish I also have an on going Java project for the board game Diplomacy and a Flutter and Dart project to make a timetable app for teachers
